are intended to be used with the formMixin and provide a shorthand\n                        method of adding a control and its label to a form, including support for\n                        managing missing and error fields automatically.\n\n                        A group has two main purposes:<br />\n\n                        <ul>\n                            <li> Wrap a form component such that it is shown with a label\n                            and arrangled within a the bootstap grid.</li>\n                            <li> Except standard props that are added to each of the wrapped form \n                            components (attrName, placeholder, validation etc) as a 'attr' object.</li>\n                        </ul>\n\n                        Within ESDB we display the same form layout for each form element over and\n                        over. This component is used to reduce all that boiler plate code. As such\n                        this component is pretty hard coded in terms of its layout: 2 columns for\n                        the label and 10 for the control.\n\n                        The Group is also meant to be used with the formMixin. The formMixing provides\n                        a getAttr() call that extracts existing formValues, meta info such as label\n                        name, placeholder name. In addition it also supplies callbacks for missing\n                        and error counts as well as value changed that are attached to functions that\n                        alter the mixin state.\n\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <div className=\"row\">\n                    <div className=\"col-md-12\">\n                        <p />\n

<Chooser initialChoiceList={this.state.animals}/>\n                        </Group>\n\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        );\n    }\n});\n\nmodule.exports

This gives you automatic tracking of errors within the form, as the user edits it, as well as a telly of required fields that are not yet filled out. The form also keeps track of initial vs final values.\\n\\nThe form elements are defined by a **schema**. Schemas can be defined with JSX or manually. Here's the schema used in this page:\\n\\n    var schema = (\\n        <Schema>\\n            <Attr name=\\\"first_name\\\" label=\\\"First name\\\" placeholder=\\\"Enter first name\\\"\\n                  required={true} validation={{\\\"type\\\": \\\"string\\\"}}/>\\n            <Attr name=\\\"last_name\\\" label=\\\"Last name\\\" placeholder=\\\"Enter last name\\\"\\n                  required={true} validation={{\\\"type\\\": \\\"string\\\"}}/>\\n            <Attr name=\\\"email\\\" label=\\\"Email\\\" placeholder=\\\"Enter valid email address\\\"\\n                  validation={{\\\"format\\\": \\\"email\\\"}}/>\\n        </Schema>\\n    );\\n\\nAs you can see the schema is used to associate the Attr name (\\\"first_name\\\" for example) with some properties which define how it looks and what is a valid value for that Attr. Here we define a label (\\\"First name\\\"), a placeholder text, and some validation properties. Required can be set true to have the form track that this Attr field needs to be filled out before the form is submitted. More on errors and missing value counts below. In addition to being required or not, the Attr can have a validation prop set which will be passed to Revalidator for field validation while the user interacts with the form. It is most common to use it to specify the type (\\\"string\\\", \\\"integer\\\", or \\\"number\\\"), but you can also specify a format, such as in the example above where the email Attr is checked to make sure it is a valid email address. Maximum string lengths, or ranges of numeric values can also be specified. For full details see the [Revalidator website](https://github.com/flatiron/revalidator).\\n\\nRendering is not automatic. Instead the form itself is a React component that you define. This React component will need to use the **FormMixin** to get the proper behavior, as well as implement a layout of the form widgets with special render method called `renderForm()`.\\n\\nWe define the form itself like this:\\n\\n    var ContactForm = React.createClass({\\n\\n        mixins: [FormMixin],\\n\\nAnd then implement the form layout like this:\\n\\n        renderForm: function() {\\n            var disableSubmit = this.hasErrors();\\n            return (\\n                <Form>\\n                    <TextEditGroup attr=\\\"first_name\\\" width={300} />\\n                    <TextEditGroup attr=\\\"last_name\\\" width={300} />\\n                    <TextEditGroup attr=\\\"email\\\" width={500} />\\n                    <hr />\\n                    <input className=\\\"btn btn-default\\\" type=\\\"submit\\\" value=\\\"Submit\\\" disabled={disableSubmit}/>\\n                </Form>\\n            );\\n        }\\n\\nAs you can see, we return a `<Form>` element which contains further JSX, which is a convenience. In fact, you can define this with a `<form>` too. You can use any JSX in here to render the form however you like. This makes the layout of the form as flexable as any other React code.\\n\\nThe special elements here are the `TextEditGroup`s. They specify an `attr` prop which references the schema (we'll see how to get the schema hooked up in a minute). Each TextEditGroup will generate a label and a form control (in this case a `TextEdit`). We use Bootstrap for the layout. In addition to TextEditGroups there's also: `TextAreaGroup`, `ChooserGroup`, `OptionsGroup` and `TagsGroup`. You can also wrap your own controls in the generic `Group`.\\n\\nNow that we have out form it's time to use it. Typically the form will be contained (rendered by) another React component which will hold the buisness logic of sourcing the schema and initial values, as well as handling the submit of the form in some way.\\n\\nTo render the form we created above we need to pass in the initial values and schema. Here is the key part of render function for this page's example:\\n\\n        render: function() {\\n            ...\\n            <ContactForm schema={schema} values={values} onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}/>\\n            ...\\n        }\\n\\nNote that the schema is required, so you cannot render the form until one is available. If this is being loaded from the server you would display a Spinner until it is available.\\n\\nCurrently values can only be passed in once. After that they will always be the initial state of the form. Changing values in later renders of the form will not change the form.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\"\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/raw-loader!./examples/markdown/form_examples.md\n ** module id = 20\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = \"###Error example###\\n\\nThe forms library has several facilities to help with tracking of errors and missing values on the form.\\n\\n#### Widgets ####\\n\\nAt the lowest level, each widget, such as a TextEdit widget, has been adapted to keep track of its status with respect to the validation rules that were passed to it, either directly or using a form schema. These rules specifiy both what kind of data or format is valid for a field as well as if the field is required or not. As the status of the form widget changes with user input (on blur and focus) the field will pass this information up to the creater of the widget via callbacks.\\n\\n#### Forms ####\\n\\nAt the next level up, a form contains many widgets. Using the Group wrappers such as TextEditGroup within a FormMixin `renderForm` method will add tracking of its widgets by adding callbacks to those widgets and keeping track of the result. The result will be a mapping of widgets to if they are currently displaying a error as well as a mapping of widget to if they are required to be filled but aren't. From these two mappings we can sum the totals and so a form knowns how many errors and missing fields exist within its widgets. To access these totals you can call `errorCount()` (or `hasErrors()`) and `missingCount()` (or `hasMissing()`) on the FormMixin component. You can also get notifications from outside of the FormMixin component by adding callbacks as props, such as in this example:\\n\\n    <ContactForm attr=\\\"contacts\\\"\\n                 schema={schema}\\n                 values={values}\\n                 onMissingCountChange={this.handleMissingCountChange}\\n                 onErrorCountChange={this.handleErrorCountChange}/>\\n\\nAn example error handler would then look like this (where attr will be the name supplied as the `attr` prop to the form (\\\"contacts\\\" in the above example) and `count` will be the number of errors in the form:\\n\\n    handleErrorCountChange: function(attr, count) {\\n        this.setState({\\\"errorCount\\\": count});\\n    },\\n\\nMissing values can be similarly handled.\\n\\nNote that all of this applied to list editors as well. Total counts of the list editors within a form will be correctly reported back up to the form.\\n\\n#### Show Required ####\\n\\nShowing the user which forms are required is a tricky user experience dance. On one hand you don't want to throw up all missing fields as errors from the beginning. That would be kind of hostile. On the other hand it needs to be clear which form fields must be filled out.\\n\\nThe way we approach this is to display each field label that is required in bold with a * next to it. This is a fairly common convention in form layouts. Secondly will can display the number of missing fields using the above described callbacks or with the Form Error widget described below. If the user has not filled out all the fields and still presses submit we place the form into a \\\"showRequired\\\" mode. In this mode all required fields will be shown in their error state (outlined in red).\\n\\nThe way this works is to call `showRequired()` on the `FormMixin`, or pass `showRequired={true}` to form. It will handle passing that down to each widget where each widget knows how to render based on that prop as well as its current required state (i.e. if it is required and not filled out, it will render in the error state).\\n\\nIn this example, showRequired is simply a state which is turned on by hitting the submit button (instead of actually submitting). We simply pass that state down to the `<ContactForm ...>` on render and the rest happens automatically.\\n\\n**Note**: The way we handle required fields may be refined over time.\\n\\n#### Form Error Component ####\\n\\nAbove all this the forms library also has a component called `FormErrors` for displaying these errors and warnings in a consistent way across our applications. This is shown in the example to the right of the form. You can, of course, just listen to the callbacks and display the totals in whatever way you want, as well as implement any other logic you need to based on them.\\n\\nHere is an example of using the FormErrors:\\n\\n    <FormErrors showRequired={this.state.showRequired}\\n                missingCount={this.state.missingCount}\\n                numErrors={this.state.errorCount} />\\n\\nIn this form we use the callbacks to hold our own state as to what the error and missing counts are, as well as the showRequired field. These are passed into the FormErrors component and the result is nicely displayed.\\n\\nThis manages three types of error/warning infomation that is displayed to the user:\\n\\n  - A hard error, which will display in preference to other messages. A hard error\\n    might be something like \\\"The form could not be saved\\\". This type of error, passed\\n    in as the `error` prop, is an object with two parts:\\n       `msg`     - The main error message\\n       `details` - Further information about the message, like \\\"Unable to make internet connection\\\", or perhaps a raw server message.\\n\\n  - error count, passed in as `numErrors` prop. If this is passed in then this\\n    component will display the number of errors on the form. This is used with the\\n    Form code so that the user can see live how many validation errors are left on\\n    the page\\n\\n  - missing count, passed in as `missingCount` prop. If there is not an error on the\\n    page but `missingCount > 0` then this component will display a n fields to complete\\n    message. If the prop 'showRequired' is passed in as true, then the form is in the\\n    mode of actually displaying as an error all missing fields. The message in this\\n    case will be simply \\\"Form incomplete\\\".\\n\\nAs mentioned above you can also pass in a direct error message to the `FormErrors` component. We use this in the case of a server error where we want that information displayed to the user.\\n\\n\\n\"\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/raw-loader!./examples/markdown/errors_examples.md\n ** module id = 21\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = \"###Dynamic form example###\\n\\nThe forms library allows you to create forms that dynamically change depending on other filled out attrs. An example of this is a form which has a type field and that field controls several other fields that only apply to that type. In this case we want to:\\n\\n * Hide and show fields in reaction to a change in the type\\n * Have hidden fields not be required, i.e. support conditional requires\\n\\n#### Render ####\\n\\nThe above example begins with a pretty simple `renderForm()` implementation. In fact there's not much to see here. Regardless of the visibility that we'll control in a minute, we can just render all the fields and the forms code will take care of selectively hiding fields for us. Here is the main part of the renderForm() function, excluding a little code to get out bookmarks map for the Bookmark chooser choice list.\\n\\n    return (\\n        <Form style={formStyle}>\\n            <ChooserGroup attr=\\\"bookmarked\\\" width={300} initialChoiceList={bookmarks}/>\\n                <hr />\\n            <TextEditGroup attr=\\\"name\\\" width={300} />\\n            <TextAreaGroup attr=\\\"description\\\" />\\n                <hr />\\n            <ChooserGroup attr=\\\"type\\\" width={200} initialChoice={this.value(\\\"type\\\")}\\n                          initialChoiceList={endpointTypes} disableSearch={true} />\\n            <TextEditGroup attr=\\\"device_name\\\" />\\n            <TextEditGroup attr=\\\"interface\\\" />\\n            <TextEditGroup attr=\\\"foreign_description\\\" />\\n            <TextEditGroup attr=\\\"organization\\\" />\\n            <TextEditGroup attr=\\\"panel_name\\\" />\\n            <TextEditGroup attr=\\\"port_id\\\" />\\n            <TextEditGroup attr=\\\"port_side\\\" />\\n            <TextEditGroup attr=\\\"port_location\\\" />\\n                <hr />\\n            <input className=\\\"btn btn-default\\\" type=\\\"submit\\\" value=\\\"Submit\\\" disabled={disableSubmit}/>\\n        </Form>\\n    );\\n\\n\\n#### Tags ####\\n\\nThe forms library schema supports visibility tags, which can be used to quickly control which set of fields show be visible and which should not, rather than setting each one. The schema for our example looks like this\\n\\n    <Schema>\\n        <Attr name=\\\"bookmarked\\\" label=\\\"\\\"  tags={[\\\"all\\\"]} />\\n        <Attr name=\\\"name\\\" label=\\\"Name\\\"  tags={[\\\"all\\\"]} required={true} />\\n        <Attr name=\\\"description\\\" label=\\\"Description\\\"  tags={[\\\"all\\\"]} required={true} />\\n        <Attr name=\\\"type\\\" label=\\\"Type\\\"  tags={[\\\"all\\\"]} required={true} />\\n        <Attr name=\\\"device_name\\\" label=\\\"Device name\\\"  tags={[\\\"Equipment Port\\\"]} required={true} />\\n        <Attr name=\\\"interface\\\" label=\\\"Interface\\\" tags={[\\\"Equipment Port\\\"]} required={true} />\\n        <Attr name=\\\"foreign_description\\\" label=\\\"Foreign description\\\" tags={[\\\"Foreign\\\"]} required={true} />\\n        <Attr name=\\\"organization\\\" label=\\\"Organization\\\" tags={[\\\"Foreign\\\"]} required={true} />\\n        <Attr name=\\\"panel_name\\\" label=\\\"Panel name\\\" tags={[\\\"Patch Panel\\\"]} required={true}  />\\n        <Attr name=\\\"port_id\\\" label=\\\"Port Id\\\" tags={[\\\"Patch Panel\\\"]} required={true} />\\n        <Attr name=\\\"port_side\\\" label=\\\"Port side\\\" tags={[\\\"Patch Panel\\\"]} required={true} />\\n        <Attr name=\\\"port_location\\\" label=\\\"Port location\\\" tags={[\\\"Patch Panel\\\"]} required={true} />\\n    </Schema>\\n\\nYou can see that for each attr we've defined a tags prop. This is a list of visibility tags. Here we've named our tags based on our type values (\\\"Equipment Port\\\", \\\"Patch Panel\\\" and \\\"Foreign\\\"). A special tag `all` can also be added meaning that the attr will always be visible.\\n\\nTo turn on visibility we use the `setVisibility()` method on the FormMixin. This method takes as its argument the tag to match against the schema to control the visibility of the attrs. For example, if we passed in \\\"Equipment Port\\\" then all the attrs with a tag of \\\"all\\\" would be shown, as would those with a tag of \\\"Equipment Port\\\" (\\\"device_name\\\" and \\\"interface\\\"). All others would be hidden.\\n\\n#### willHandleChange() ####\\n\\nNext we need a place to respond to the change in attribute. The FormsMixin code provides for this with a hook function called `willHandleChange` that is called when a value is changed (either by the user or programmatically). It is possible to use this function to change other form state (as we'll do here), or if you return a value, actually modify the value before it is stored in the form. Here is our implementation of willHandleChange:\\n\\n    willHandleChange: function(attrName, value) {\\n        switch (attrName) {\\n            case \\\"type\\\":\\n                this.setVisibility(endpointTypes[value]);\\n                break;\\n            case \\\"bookmarked\\\":\\n                if (value) {\\n                    //Id was changed so transfer existing endpoint values onto the form\\n                    var endpoint = bookmarked[value];\\n                    this.setValue(\\\"name\\\", endpoint.name);\\n                    this.setValue(\\\"description\\\", endpoint.description);\\n                    this.setValue(\\\"type\\\", endpoint.type);\\n                    this.setValue(\\\"device_name\\\", endpoint.device_name);\\n                    this.setValue(\\\"interface\\\", endpoint.interface);\\n                    this.setValue(\\\"foreign_description\\\", endpoint.foreign_description);\\n                    this.setValue(\\\"organization\\\", endpoint.organization);\\n                    this.setValue(\\\"panel_name\\\", endpoint.panel_name);\\n                    this.setValue(\\\"port_id\\\", endpoint.port_id);\\n                    this.setValue(\\\"port_side\\\", endpoint.port_side);\\n                    this.setValue(\\\"port_location\\\", endpoint.port_location);\\n                }\\n                break;\\n        }\\n    },\\n\\nFor our example we allow the user to switch between different pre-set bookmarked endpoints. In response willHandleChange will be called with the attrName being \\\"bookmarked\\\", which we handle in the second part of the switch statement. In response we set the bookmarked endpoint's values on the form itself.\\n\\nThe subtle thing here to note is that one of the attrs we are setting is `type`. This is also a handled attr in willHandleChange and will be taken care of in the first part of the switch statement. This is what controls the visibility based on the type as it calls `setVisibility()` with the set type (converted from id to string).\\n\\nIn the UI it is also possible to just change the type directly, in which case the first part of the switch statement handles this directly and fields are shown and hidden based on the setVisibility() call.\\n\\n#### getInitialVisibility() ####\\n\\nThe final thing to note in this example is how you control the initial visibility state. This is done with a hook function called `getInitialVisibility()`. You implement this to return the tag you want to show.\\n\\n    getInitialVisibility: function() {\\n        return endpointTypes[this.props.values[\\\"type\\\"]];\\n    },\\n\\n\\n\"\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/raw-loader!./examples/markdown/dynamic_examples.md\n ** module id = 22\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = \"###List example###\\n\\nTo create a list that can be added and removed, the Forms library provides a ListEditorMixin.\\n\\nThe first step is to create the item itself. The item can be a form itself (i.e. use the FormMixin) but it doesn't have to be. If it is, values, as well as error and missing count information will flow up to the List itself. In the case of this example we do have a little form that asks for the email address and email type. In that case we specify a schema and a form component to render that form:\\n\\n    var emailSchema = (\\n        <Schema>\\n            <Attr name=\\\"email\\\" defaultValue=\\\"\\\" label=\\\"Email\\\" required={true} validation={{\\\"format\\\": \\\"email\\\"}}/>\\n            <Attr name=\\\"email_type\\\" defaultValue={1} label=\\\"Type\\\" required={true}/>\\n        </Schema>\\n    );\\n\\n    /**\\n     * Renders a form for entering an email address\\n     */\\n    var EmailItemEditor = React.createClass({\\n\\n        mixins: [FormMixin],\\n\\n        renderForm: function() {\\n            var id = this.value(\\\"email_type\\\");\\n            return (\\n                <div>\\n                    <ChooserGroup attr=\\\"email_type\\\"\\n                                  initialChoice={id}\\n                                  initialChoiceList={emailTypes}\\n                                  disableSearch={true}\\n                                  width={100} />\\n                    <TextEditGroup attr=\\\"email\\\" width={300} />\\n                </div>\\n            );\\n        }\\n    });\\n\\nHaving defined that, we can now use it in the list itself:\\n\\n    var EmailListEditor = React.createClass({\\n\\n        mixins: [ListEditorMixin],\\n\\n        /**  Set initial items */\\n        initialItems: function() {\\n            return this.props.emails || [];\\n        },\\n\\n        /** Create a new item */\\n        createItem: function() {\\n            return {\\n                \\\"email\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n                \\\"email_type\\\": 1\\n            };\\n        },\\n\\n        /** Render one of the items */\\n        renderItem: function(item) {\\n            return (\\n                <EmailItemEditor schema={emailSchema}\\n                                 values={item} />\\n            );\\n        },\\n    });\\n\\nHere we see the main pieces of the API:\\n\\n* `initialItems()` is used to populate the initial list, which in this case we pass in as a prop from the larger contact form. It is an array of objects, each object containing the `email` and `email_type`.\\n\\n* `createItem()` is the new item creation function. This is called when the [+] button is pressed. It is expected to return an object reprsenting the new item of the list. In this case we create an empty email and a default type.\\n\\n* `renderItem()` is called to render each item. It will be called for each item as the list itself renders. Passed in is the item to render. In our case we return an instance of our `EmailItemEditor` form, passing in the item as the values for the form.\\n\\nFinally, to use the `EmailListEditor` in our main form's `renderForm()` we surround it with a <Group> like so:\\n\\n    <Group attr=\\\"emails\\\" >\\n        <EmailListEditor emails={emails}/>\\n    </Group>\\n\\n---\\n\"\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/raw-loader!./examples/markdown/list_examples.md\n ** module id = 23\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","// style-loader: Adds some css to the DOM by adding a <style> tag\n\n// load the styles\nvar content = require(\"!!/Users/peter/Code/esnet-react-forms/node_modules/css-loader/index.js!/Users/peter/Code/esnet-react-forms/examples/modules/app.css\");\nif(typeof content === 'string') content = [[module.id, content, '']];\n// add the styles to the DOM\nvar update = require(\"!/Users/peter/Code/esnet-react-forms/node_modules/style-loader/addStyles.js\")(content, {});\n// Hot Module Replacement\nif(module.hot) {\n\t// When the styles change, update the <style> tags\n\tmodule.hot.accept(\"!!/Users/peter/Code/esnet-react-forms/node_modules/css-loader/index.js!/Users/peter/Code/esnet-react-forms/examples/modules/app.css\", function() {\n\t\tvar newContent = require(\"!!/Users/peter/Code/esnet-react-forms/node_modules/css-loader/index.js!/Users/peter/Code/esnet-react-forms/examples/modules/app.css\");\n\t\tif(typeof newContent === 'string') newContent = [[module.id, newContent, '']];\n\t\tupdate(newContent);\n\t});\n\t// When the module is disposed, remove the <style> tags\n\tmodule.hot.dispose(function() { update(); });\n}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./examples/modules/app.css\n ** module id = 24\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","exports = module.exports = require(\"/Users/peter/Code/esnet-react-forms/node_modules/css-loader/cssToString.js\")();\nexports.push([module.id, \"body {\\n    font-family: 'Arial';\\n}\\n\\n.docs-sidenav {\\n    margin-top: 20px;\\n    margin-bottom: 20px;\\n}\\n\\n.docs-sidebar .nav > li > a {\\n    color: #CCC;\\n    background: #FFF;\\n    display: block;\\n    padding: 4px 20px;\\n    font-size: 15px;\\n    font-weight: 500;\\n}\\n\\n.docs-sidebar .nav > li > a.active {\\n    color: #000;\\n    font-weight: 600;\\n    background: #FFF;\\n    border-bottom-style: solid;\\n    border-bottom-color: #2DB3D1;\\n}\", \"\"]);\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/css-loader!./examples/modules/app.css\n ** module id = 25\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","//     Underscore.js 1.8.2\n//     http://underscorejs.org\n//     (c) 2009-2015 Jeremy Ashkenas, DocumentCloud and Investigative Reporters & Editors\n//     Underscore may be freely distributed under the MIT license.\n\n(function() {\n\n  // Baseline setup\n  // --------------\n\n  // Establish the root object, `window` in the browser, or `exports` on the server.\n  var root = this;\n\n  // Save the previous value of the `_` variable.\n  var previousUnderscore = root._;\n\n  // Save bytes in the minified (but not gzipped) version:\n  var ArrayProto = Array.prototype, ObjProto = Object.prototype, FuncProto = Function.prototype;\n\n  // Create quick reference variables for speed access to core prototypes.\n  var\n    push             = ArrayProto.push,\n    slice            = ArrayProto.slice,\n    toString         = ObjProto.toString,\n    hasOwnProperty   = ObjProto.hasOwnProperty;\n\n  // All **ECMAScript 5** native function implementations that we hope to use\n  // are declared here.\n  var\n    nativeIsArray      = Array.isArray,\n    nativeKeys         = Object.keys,\n    nativeBind         = FuncProto.bind,\n    nativeCreate       = Object.create;\n\n  // Naked function reference for surrogate-prototype-swapping.\n  var Ctor = function(){};\n\n  // Create a safe reference to the Underscore object for use below.\n  var _ = function(obj) {\n    if (obj instanceof _) return obj;\n    if (!(this instanceof _)) return new _(obj);\n    this._wrapped = obj;\n  };\n\n  // Export the Underscore object for **Node.js**, with\n  // backwards-compatibility for the old `require()` API.

- The attributes to be tracked by this form, specifying\n *                meta data associated with each of those attributes\n *\n * To set initial values for the form, use the setValues() method.\n * Internally the state formValues will contain the Initial and current value\n * as the form is edited by the user.\n *\n * Note: You can not currently pass values in as a prop.\n *\n * When building the initial state, the schema will be\n * converted to an internal state representation containing:\n *\n *   formAttrs  - General meta data about each attribute\n *   formRules  - Required state and validation rules\n *\n * The getAttr() call:\n *\n *   The getAttr() call is supplied with an attrName and collects\n *   together meta data, rules and values associated with that attr\n *   from formAttrs, formRules and formValues. It also attaches callbacks\n *   for missing count, error count, and attr value changes. The\n *   resulting structure can be passed to any of the Group wrapper components\n *   directly so that the display of the control has all the correct\n *   meta data and so that changes to the value and resulting errors\n *   etc, are bubbled up to the formMixin for counting.\n *\n * Missing and Error counts:\n *\n *   The state variables errorCounts and missingCounts hold the current counts\n *   of missing values or errors within the form, keyed by their attrName.\n *   These are maintained via the callbacks added to the form widgets with\n *   the use of the getAttr() helper function. Total errorCounts on the form\n *   can be found with the errorCount() function. Similarly, total missing\n *   counts can be found with the missingCount() function.\n *\n * Showing required values:\n *\n *   The current version of ESDB forms will only show an error outline around\n *   unfilled required fields when the user tries and fails to submit the form.\n *   Until then it shows the number of unfilled form items as a more gentle\n *   approach. We may revisit this in the future. To support this, the form\n *   uses the showRequired state value to specify if each widget in the form\n *   should actually show the error state if the field is required but not\n *   filled. You can use the two fuctions on the mixin: showRequiredOn() and\n *   showRequiredOff() to control this state, while showRequired() will return\n *   that state.\n *\n * Dynamic forms:\n *\n *   Sometimes a form will show and hide controls based on the value of another\n *   control. The way to control many fields coming and going from the form is to\n *   tag them (in the schema) and then use setVisible(tag) to update the mixin\n *   internal state to just take those into consideration.\n */\nvar FormMixin = {\n\n    propTypes: {\n        schema: React.PropTypes.object.isRequired,\n    },\n\n    getInitialState: function() {\n        //Schema must be passed in as a prop\n        var schema = this.props.schema;\n        var attrs = schema.attrs();\n        var rules = schema.rules();\n\n        var hidden = [];\n\n        //Values might be passed in as a prop\n        var initialValues = Copy(this.props.values);\n\n        //Setup formValues\n        var values = {};\n        _.each(attrs, function(attr, attrName) {\n            var defaultValue = _.has(attr, \"defaultValue\") ? attr[\"defaultValue\"] : undefined;\n            if (initialValues) {\n                var v = _.has(initialValues, attrName) ? initialValues[attrName] : defaultValue;\n                values[attrName] = {\"value\": v, \"initialValue\": v};\n            } else {\n                values[attrName] = {\"value\": defaultValue, \"initialValue\": defaultValue};\n            }\n        });\n\n        var hidden = [];\n        if (this.getInitialVisibility) {\n            var tag = this.getInitialVisibility();\n            if (tag) {\n                _.each(attrs, function(attr, attrName) {\n                    var makeHidden;\n                    var tags = attr.tags || [];\n                    if (_.isArray(tag)) {\n                        makeHidden = !(_.intersection(tags, tag).length > 0 || _.contains(tags, \"all\"));\n                    } else {\n                        makeHidden = !(_.contains(tags, tag) || _.contains(tags, \"all\"));\n                    }\n                    if (makeHidden) {\n                        hidden.push(attrName);\n                    }\n                });\n            }\n        }\n\n        return {\n            errorCounts: {},\n            missingCounts: {},\n            formAttrs: attrs,\n            formRules: rules,\n            formValues: values,\n            formHiddenList: hidden\n        };\n    },\n\n    /**\n     * Collect together a data structure for the given attrName which can\n     * be passed to any of the Group wrapped form widgets.

A hard error\n *     might be something like \"The form could not be saved\". This type of error, passed\n *     in as the 'error' prop, is an object with two parts:\n *         * msg     - The main error message\n *         * details - Further information about the message\n *   - error count, passed in as 'numErrors' prop. If this is passed in then this\n *     component will display the number of errors on the form. This is used with the\n *     Form code so that the user can see live how many validation errors are left on\n *     the page\n *   - missing count, passed in as 'missingCount' prop.
